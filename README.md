Escape the Apartment Game
Welcome to the "Escape the Apartment" game! In this challenging escape room experience, you find yourself trapped in a small apartment. Your goal is to complete a series of tasks and puzzles to unlock the main door and escape. Be mindful of the countdown, as you only have a limited amount of time to solve the puzzles.

Getting Started
When you start the game, you'll be in the living room of the apartment.
A text canvas in front of you will display game instructions, and a countdown will start from 10 seconds.
You'll hear the ticking sound of a microwave clock on the kitchen counter, indicating the time limit for the game.
The time limit can be randomly set to 5, 10, or 15 minutes.
Gameplay
Once the countdown reaches zero, the text canvas disappears, and the microwave clock starts counting down the remaining time.
You must complete a series of tasks to escape the apartment.
The order of the tasks is randomly decided at the start of the game but follows logical progression.
Completing a subset of tasks in the living room will open the bedroom door, signified by a sound.
Completing tasks in the bedroom will open the bathroom door.
In the bathroom, you'll find a 4-digit code to open the main door and escape.
Lighting
The lighting in the apartment changes based on the remaining time:
Normal color (whitish) if there's more than 2 minutes left.
Yellowish if there are 1 to 2 minutes left.
Reddish if there's less than 1 minute left.
Winning and Losing
If you complete all the tasks within the time limit, you can open the main door and receive a "You win! Well done." message.
If you run out of time, a message for losing the game will be displayed.
There is a "Quit" button to close the application.
Additional Tasks
In addition to the basic tasks mentioned, you may encounter:
Turning on a lamp, which provides a hint for the next task.
Turning on a laptop, which displays a hint for the next task.
Turning on a TV, which also provides hints.
Collecting objects with physical properties and placing them on a weighing scale.
Opening and closing various doors.
Feel free to explore and interact with the environment, and remember that the order of tasks is dynamic, so pay close attention to hints and clues to progress through the game. Enjoy your escape room challenge!
