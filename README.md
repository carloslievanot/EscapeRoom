## Introduction

Welcome to the Unity 3D Apartment Escape Game! In this immersive experience, you find yourself in a small apartment with a mission to escape. As you explore the apartment, you will encounter various tasks and challenges that must be completed before you can unlock the main door and win the game.

## Interaction and Concepts

### Interaction Concepts

This project showcases fundamental interactions in Unity, focusing on scripting, activation and deactivation of objects during runtime, 3D audio integration, and dynamic lighting control. These elements contribute to an immersive and engaging gaming experience.

- **Virtual Navigation:** You'll navigate the game environment using a touchpad, simulating a gliding or flying metaphor.

- **Manipulation with Ray Casting:** Interact with objects by casting a ray at an offset distance, allowing you to move and manipulate them.

- **Scripting:** Various scripts control the behavior of objects and game elements during runtime, making the apartment come to life.

- **Activation/Deactivation of Objects:** Objects are dynamically activated and deactivated, adding complexity to the gameplay as you progress.

- **3D Audio Integration:** The project includes 3D audio, creating a lifelike soundscape that reacts to your movements and interactions.

- **Lighting Control:** Lighting within the apartment changes dynamically based on your progress and remaining time, adding visual interest and signaling game status.

### Game Logics

The game's flow is managed by a set of game logics, ensuring tasks are completed in a logical sequence. Opening doors and progressing through the game is directly linked to your accomplishments.

## Game Tasks

A set of tasks must be completed to escape the apartment. These tasks are randomly ordered but follow a logical progression. You must:

- Turn on a lamp, which provides hints for the next task.
- Turn on a laptop, which displays hints for the following task.
- Turn on a TV, providing hints for the next objective.
- Collect objects and place them on a weighing scale to reach a specific weight.
- Open and close the doors, including the bedroom, bathroom, and main door.

Feel free to add more assets and 3D models with relevant behavior to enhance the gaming experience.

## Testing and Script Review

To fully appreciate and understand these interactions, it is encouraged to test them thoroughly within the game. Experiment with the virtual navigation, ray casting, and object manipulation. Take note of how scripting influences the behavior of objects and the environment.

Moreover, explore the 3D audio integration and pay attention to how sounds react to your movements. Finally, observe the dynamic changes in lighting as you progress through the game.

Don't forget to review the scripts that power these interactions. Understanding the code will provide valuable insights into how these mechanics work. Whether you're a player or a developer, these interactions and concepts are fundamental to creating an engaging Unity 3D experience.
